# More Than Certified - Terraform

### How to use this repo

git clone https://github.com/morethancertified/mtc-terraform.git

Each directory is named after the lesson to which it refers. Within each directory, you will find the files that
correspond to the final configuration for that lesson.

If you wish to start with the configuration used at the beginning of a lesson, use the directory from the previous lesson. 

Don't forget to run a `terraform init` for each new directory you use!
